### *Remotely Connecting*
1. Once you have VSCode open, open your new terminal by going to “terminal” in the top left menu bar and clicking “new terminal.”
2. After you have your terminal open, type in “ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu” but instead of “zz,” substitute your account email. 
3. If by chance, it asks when you want to continue connecting, type in “yes” and press enter
4. Afterwards, it will ask for your password. It will be easier for you to write your password down somewhere else and copy/paste because there is no visibility for your password. 
5. Once you are logged in, you will be on the remote server, and you will see something similar to the image below.
